What's broken:
Differential privacy has a fatal bug. The new _apply_dp_to_facts method does two things: adds Gaussian noise to the fact count to get noisy_count, then samples that many facts. The sampling is the right idea — it limits how much any single episode can influence the output. But line 214: random.seed(42). This is a fixed seed. The comment says "Deterministic but different per cluster due to content" — that's wrong. The seed is 42 every single time regardless of content. The content influences which facts are in the list, but given the same list, the same subset will always be chosen. An adversary who knows the seed (it's in the source code) can exactly predict which facts survive sampling for any input. This completely negates the privacy guarantee. Remove the random.seed(42) line — the noise from add_noise already provides the randomness needed for the count; the sampling itself should use unseeded randomness.
Additionally, the fix is inconsistently applied. The Distiller's result metadata counts had their noise removed (correct — the comment says "Metadata noise removed as it doesn't provide meaningful privacy guarantees"). But the Gardener still has the exact same metadata-noise pattern on clusters_found, insights_generated, and episodes_archived — 40 lines of identical noise-on-counts code that was deemed meaningless in the Distiller but left untouched in the Gardener. And write_consolidated in the Distiller still adds noise to confidence_score in the frontmatter (line 241-243), which is again a metadata field, not a fact.
Delta encoding is dead code — again. delta.py is solid: compute_delta uses SequenceMatcher to find matching blocks and emits a clean copy/insert/end opcode stream. apply_delta reconstructs correctly. find_similar_objects groups by similarity. write_pack_with_delta in pack.py imports all of it, runs similarity grouping, computes deltas, and only uses a delta if it's at least 20% smaller than the original (good threshold). But run_repack — the only function that actually gets called when you run agmem gc --repack — calls write_pack(), not write_pack_with_delta(). One function name change on line 443 and this works. This is the exact same pattern as the compression pipeline was in 0.1.6.
The coordinator and client don't speak the same protocol. The server's PushRequest expects:
{"summary": {"agent_id": "...", "timestamp": "...", "topic_counts": {...}, "fact_hashes": [...]}}
The client's push_updates sends the raw output of produce_local_summary, which is:
{"memory_types": [...], "topics": {...}, "topic_hashes": {...}, "fact_count": N}
No agent_id is generated anywhere on the client side. No timestamp is added. The key names don't match (topics vs topic_counts; fact_count is an int vs fact_hashes which should be a list of hash strings). The client also doesn't wrap it in a {"summary": ...} envelope. This will return a 422 Validation Error on the first push. Additionally, both coordinator_version and the FastAPI version= are hardcoded to "0.1.6" — copy-paste leftovers.

One new issue:
levenshtein_distance in delta.py is O(n × m) on raw byte sequences. For two 5KB semantic files that's 25 million cell computations per pair. find_similar_objects runs this on every pair of candidate objects — O(objects² × size²). With 100 blobs averaging 2KB each, that's 10,000 pairs × 4 million cells = 40 billion operations before any packing starts. This will hang. It needs a pre-filter: either a fast approximate metric (MinHash, simhash, or even just a length ratio check) to eliminate obviously-dissimilar pairs before running the expensive distance computation, or a hard cap on the max object size that gets compared.

What's still missing entirely: Unit tests. The package now has cryptographic signing, AES-GCM encryption, pack files with binary-search indexes, delta encoding, Merkle proofs, distributed locking, and differential privacy noise injection — and zero automated test coverage for any of it. test_runner.py validates your agent's memory content at runtime; it doesn't test the package. This is the single biggest risk in the project.
